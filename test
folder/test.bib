  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Reducing the global burden of injury requires both
               injury prevention and improved trauma care. We sought to provide
               an estimate of the number of lives that could be saved by
               improvements in trauma care, especially in low income and middle
               income countries. METHODS: Prior data showed differences in case
               fatality rates for seriously injured persons (Injury Severity
               Score $\geq$ 9) in three separate locations: Seattle, WA (high
               income; case fatality 35\%); Monterrey, Mexico (middle income;
               case fatality 55\%); and Kumasi, Ghana (low income; case
               fatality 63\%). For the present study, total numbers of injury
               deaths in all countries in different economic strata were
               obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study. The number of
               lives that could potentially be saved from improvements in
               trauma care globally was calculated as the difference in current
               number of deaths from trauma in low income and middle income
               countries minus the number of deaths that would have occurred if
               case fatality rates in these locations were decreased to the
               case fatality rate in high income countries. RESULTS: Between
               1,730,000 and 1,965,000 lives could be saved in low income and
               middle income countries if case fatality rates among seriously
               injured persons could be reduced to those in high income
               countries. This amounts to 34-38\% of all injury deaths.
               CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of lives could be saved by
               improvements in trauma care globally. This is another piece of
               evidence in support of investment in and greater attention to
               strengthening trauma care services globally.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: The injury severity score (ISS) and new injury severity
               score (NISS) have been widely used in trauma evaluation.
               However, which scoring system is better in trauma outcome
               prediction is still disputed. The purpose of this study is to
               evaluate the value of the two scoring systems in predicting
               trauma outcomes, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU)
               admission and ICU length of stay. METHODS: The data were
               collected retrospectively from three hospitals in Zhejiang
               province, China. The comparisons of NISS and ISS in predicting
               outcomes were performed by using receiver operator
               characteristic (ROC) curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics.
               RESULTS: A total of 1825 blunt trauma patients were enrolled in
               our study. Finally, 1243 patients were admitted to ICU, and 215
               patients died before discharge. The ISS and NISS were equivalent
               in predicting mortality (area under ORC curve [AUC]: 0.886 vs.
               0.887, p = 0.9113). But for the patients with ISS $\geq$25, NISS
               showed better performance in predicting mortality. NISS was also
               significantly better than ISS in predicting ICU admission and
               prolonged ICU length of stay. CONCLUSION: NISS outperforms ISS
               in predicting the outcomes for severe blunt trauma and can be an
               essential supplement of ISS. Considering the convenience of NISS
               in calculation, it is advantageous to promote NISS in China's
               primary hospitals.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Traumatic injuries represent a considerable public
               health burden with significant personal and societal costs. The
               care of the severely injured patient in a trauma system
               progresses along a continuum that includes numerous
               interventions being provided by a multidisciplinary group of
               healthcare personnel. Despite the recent emphasis on quality of
               care in medicine, there has been little research to direct
               trauma clinicians and administrators on how optimally to monitor
               and improve upon the quality of care delivered within a trauma
               system. Audit filters are one mechanism for improving quality of
               care and are defined as specific clinical processes or outcomes
               of care that, when they occur, represent unfavorable deviations
               from an established norm and which prompt review and feedback.
               Although audit filters are widely utilized for performance
               improvement in trauma systems they have not been subjected to
               systematic review of their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To
               determine the effectiveness of using audit filters for improving
               processes of care and clinical outcomes in trauma systems.
               SEARCH STRATEGY: Our search strategy included an electronic
               search of the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialized Register, the
               Cochrane EPOC Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane
               Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ISI
               Web of Science: (SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S). We handsearched the
               Journal of Trauma, Injury, Annals of Emergency Medicine,
               Academic Emergency Medicine, and Injury Prevention. We searched
               two clinical trial registries: 1) The World Health Organization
               International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and, 2) Clinical
               Trials.gov. We also contacted content experts for further
               articles. The most recent electronic search was completed in
               December 2008 and the handsearch was completed up to February
               2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomized controlled
               trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after
               studies, and interrupted time series studies that used audit
               filters as an intervention for improving processes of care,
               morbidity, or mortality for severely injured patients. DATA
               COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the
               search results, applied inclusion criteria, and extracted data.
               MAIN RESULTS: There were no studies identified that met the
               inclusion criteria for this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We
               were unable to identify any studies of sufficient methodological
               quality to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of audit
               filters as a performance improvement intervention in trauma
               systems. Future research using rigorous study designs should
               focus on the relative effectiveness of audit filters in
               comparison to alternative quality improvement strategies at

               preventable deaths, and classify all the errors with universal
               language. METHODS: We studied all trauma patients over 16
               admitted to the critical care unit or who died before. In
               multidisciplinary sessions we decided which deaths were
               preventable, potentially preventable and non preventable. Guided
               by ATLS protocols, we detected errors in their management that
               were classified using the taxonomy of Joint Commission. RESULTS:
               We registered 1236 trauma patients (ISS 20.77). Of the 115
               trauma deaths, 19 were preventable or potentially preventable
               deaths. We recorded 130 errors in all deaths, 46 of them in
               preventable or potentially preventable deaths. Using our own
               classification, the main errors were delay in starting correct
               treatment or performance of CT in hemodynamically unstable
               patients. Using the taxonomy of Joint Commission, the main type
               error was clinical, during the intervention: the delay in
               initiating correct treatment. Mistakes were made in the
               emergency department by medical specialists. The incidence of
               therapeutic and diagnostic errors was similar. The main cause of
               error was human failure, specifically 'rule-based' errors

               step on the way to improving the quality of care for trauma
               patients. A common language like the taxonomy of Joint

               proportion includes 51\% of prehospital contacts, 67\% of those
               treated in the emergency department (ED), and 40\% of those
               treated post-ED (operating room, intensive care unit, and
               floor). Issues with care were predominantly related to
               management of the airway, fluid resuscitation, and chest injury
               diagnosis and management. CONCLUSIONS: The preventable death
               rate from trauma demonstrated in Utah is similar to that found
               in other settings where the trauma system is under development
               but has not reached full maturity. OFIs predominantly exist in
               the ED and relate to airway management, fluid resuscitation, and
               chest injury management. Resource organization and education of
               ED primary care providers in basic principles of stabilization
               and initial treatment may be the most cost-effective method of
               reducing preventable deaths in this mixed urban and rural
               setting. Similar opportunities exist in the prehospital and
               post-ED phases of care.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma
               has created a ``Trauma Quality Improvement Program'' (TQIP) that
               uses the existing infrastructure of Committee on Trauma
               programs. As the first step toward full implementation of TQIP,
               a pilot study was conducted in 23 American College of Surgeons
               verified or state designated Level I and II trauma centers. This
               study details the feasibility and acceptance of TQIP among the
               participating centers. METHODS: Data from the National Trauma
               Data Bank for patients admitted to pilot study hospitals during
               2007 were used (15,801 patients). A multivariable logistic
               regression model was developed to estimate risk-adjusted
               mortality in aggregate and on three prespecified subgroups (1:
               blunt multisystem, 2: penetrating truncal, and 3: blunt
               single-system injury). Benchmark reports were developed with
               each center's risk adjusted mortality (expressed as an
               observed-to-expected [O/E] mortality ratio and 90\% confidence
               interval [CI]) and crude complication rates available for
               comparison. Reports were deidentified with only the recipient
               having access to their performance relative to their peers.
               Feedback from individual centers regarding the utility of the
               reports was collected by survey. RESULTS: Overall crude
               mortality was 7.7\% and in cohorts 1 to 3 was 16.4\%, 12.4\%,
               and 5.1\%, respectively. In the aggregate risk-adjusted
               analysis, three trauma centers were low outliers (O/E and 90\%
               CI 1) with the remaining 18 centers demonstrating average
               mortality. Challenges identified were in benchmarking mortality
               after penetrating injury due to small sample size and in the
               limited capture of complications. Ninety-two percent of survey
               respondents found the report clear and understandable, and 90\%
               thought that the report was useful. Sixty-three percent of
               respondents will be taking action based on the report.
               CONCLUSIONS: Using the National Trauma Data Bank infrastructure
               to provide risk-adjusted benchmarking of trauma center mortality
               is feasible and perceived as useful. There are differences in
               O/E ratios across similarly verified or designated centers.
               Substantial work is required to allow for morbidity
               benchmarking.",

              and medical expenses of hospitalized adult trauma patients.
              SETTING: This study was based at a level I trauma center in
              Taiwan. METHODS: Data for 17,855 adult patients hospitalized from
              January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2015 were retrieved from the
              Trauma Registry System. The primary outcome was in-hospital
              mortality. Secondary outcomes were the hospital length of stay
              (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, ICU LOS, and
              medical expenses. Chi-square tests were used for categorical
              variables to determine the significance of the associations
              between the predictor and outcome variables. Student t-tests were
              applied to analyze normally distributed data for continuous
              variables, while Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare
              non-normally distributed data. RESULTS: According to the survival
              rate-to-severity score relationship curve, we grouped all adult
              trauma patients based on EISS scores of $\geq$ 27, 9-26, and < 9.
              Significantly higher mortality rates were noted in patients with
              EISS $\geq$ 27 and those with EISS of 9-26 when compared to
              patients with EISS < 9; this finding concurred to the findings
              for groups classified by the ISS and NISS with the cut-off points
              set between 25 and 16. The hospital LOS, ICU admission rates, and
              medical expenses for patients with EISS $\geq$ 27 and patients
              with EISS of 9-26 were also significantly longer and higher than
              that of patients with EISS < 9. When comparing the demographics
              and detailed medical expenses of very severely injured adult
              trauma patients classified according to ISS, NISS, and EISS,
              patients with ISS $\geq$ 25 and NISS $\geq$ 25 both had
              significantly lower mortality rates, lower ICU admission rates,
              and shorter ICU LOS compared to patients with EISS $\geq$ 27.
              CONCLUSIONS: EISS 9 and 27 can serve as two cut-off points
              regarding injury severity, and patients with EISS $\geq$ 27 have
              the greatest injury severity. Additionally, these patients have
              the highest mortality rate, the highest ICU admission rate, and
              the longest ICU LOS compared to those with ISS $\geq$ 25 and NISS
              $\geq$ 25, suggesting that patients with EISS $\geq$ 27 have the
              worst outcome.",

               Prospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was
               a prospective observational study on two hundred elderly trauma
               patients who were admitted to JSS Hospital, Mysuru over a
               consecutive period of 18 months between December 2016 to May
               2018. On the day of admission, data were collected from each
               patient to compute the ISS, NISS, RTS, and TRISS. RESULTS: Mean
               age of patients was 66.35 years. Most common mechanism of injury
               was road traffic accident (94.0\%) with mortality of 17.0\%. The

               mortality in elderly trauma patient using TRISS system was a
               score of 91.6 (sensitivity 97\%, specificity of 88\%, area under
               ROC curve 0.972), similarly cutoff point under the NISS was
               score of 17(91\%, 93\%, 0.970); for ISS best cutoff point was at
               15(91\%, 89\%, 0.963) and for RTS it was 7.108(97\%,80\%,0.947).
               There were statistical differences among ISS, NISS, RTS and
               TRISS in terms of area under the ROC curve (p <0.0001).
               CONCLUSION: TRISS was the strongest predictor of mortality in

               transfusions, thromboembolic events and organ failure. RESULTS:
               The Fib+ group, despite having similar ISS as Fib-, had higher
               prevalence of penetrating trauma and lower Glasgow Coma Scale
               (GCS), indicating more severe injuries. Patients receiving FC
               had a higher mortality after 24 h/ 30 days/ 1 year compared to
               controls (Fib-). However, in a propensity score matched model,
               the differences in mortality between Fib+ and Fib- were no
               longer significant. Blood transfusions were more common in the
               Fib+ group, but no difference was observed in thromboembolic
               events or organ failure. In both groups, low as well as high
               P-fibrinogen levels at arrival were associated with increased
               mortality, with the lowest mortality observed at P-fibrinogen
               values of 2-3 g/l. CONCLUSIONS: Despite equal ISS, patients
               receiving FC had a higher mortality compared to the control
               group, presumably associated to the fact that these patients
               were bleeding and physiologically deranged on arrival. When
               applying a propensity score matching approach, the difference in
               mortality between the groups was no longer significant. No
               differences were observed between the groups regarding
               thromboembolic events or organ failure, despite higher
               transfusion volumes in patients receiving FC.",
