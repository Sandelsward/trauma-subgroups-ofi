  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Reducing the global burden of injury requires both
               injury prevention and improved trauma care. We sought to provide
               an estimate of the number of lives that could be saved by
               improvements in trauma care, especially in low income and middle
               income countries. METHODS: Prior data showed differences in case
               fatality rates for seriously injured persons (Injury Severity
               Score $\geq$ 9) in three separate locations: Seattle, WA (high
               income; case fatality 35\%); Monterrey, Mexico (middle income;
               case fatality 55\%); and Kumasi, Ghana (low income; case
               fatality 63\%). For the present study, total numbers of injury
               deaths in all countries in different economic strata were
               obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study. The number of
               lives that could potentially be saved from improvements in
               trauma care globally was calculated as the difference in current
               number of deaths from trauma in low income and middle income
               countries minus the number of deaths that would have occurred if
               case fatality rates in these locations were decreased to the
               case fatality rate in high income countries. RESULTS: Between
               1,730,000 and 1,965,000 lives could be saved in low income and
               middle income countries if case fatality rates among seriously
               injured persons could be reduced to those in high income
               countries. This amounts to 34-38\% of all injury deaths.
               CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of lives could be saved by
               improvements in trauma care globally. This is another piece of
               evidence in support of investment in and greater attention to
               strengthening trauma care services globally.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: The injury severity score (ISS) and new injury severity
               score (NISS) have been widely used in trauma evaluation.
               However, which scoring system is better in trauma outcome
               prediction is still disputed. The purpose of this study is to
               evaluate the value of the two scoring systems in predicting
               trauma outcomes, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU)
               admission and ICU length of stay. METHODS: The data were
               collected retrospectively from three hospitals in Zhejiang
               province, China. The comparisons of NISS and ISS in predicting
               outcomes were performed by using receiver operator
               characteristic (ROC) curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics.
               RESULTS: A total of 1825 blunt trauma patients were enrolled in
               our study. Finally, 1243 patients were admitted to ICU, and 215
               patients died before discharge. The ISS and NISS were equivalent
               in predicting mortality (area under ORC curve [AUC]: 0.886 vs.
               0.887, p = 0.9113). But for the patients with ISS $\geq$25, NISS
               showed better performance in predicting mortality. NISS was also
               significantly better than ISS in predicting ICU admission and
               prolonged ICU length of stay. CONCLUSION: NISS outperforms ISS
               in predicting the outcomes for severe blunt trauma and can be an
               essential supplement of ISS. Considering the convenience of NISS
               in calculation, it is advantageous to promote NISS in China's
               primary hospitals.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Traumatic injuries represent a considerable public
               health burden with significant personal and societal costs. The
               care of the severely injured patient in a trauma system
               progresses along a continuum that includes numerous
               interventions being provided by a multidisciplinary group of
               healthcare personnel. Despite the recent emphasis on quality of
               care in medicine, there has been little research to direct
               trauma clinicians and administrators on how optimally to monitor
               and improve upon the quality of care delivered within a trauma
               system. Audit filters are one mechanism for improving quality of
               care and are defined as specific clinical processes or outcomes
               of care that, when they occur, represent unfavorable deviations
               from an established norm and which prompt review and feedback.
               Although audit filters are widely utilized for performance
               improvement in trauma systems they have not been subjected to
               systematic review of their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To
               determine the effectiveness of using audit filters for improving
               processes of care and clinical outcomes in trauma systems.
               SEARCH STRATEGY: Our search strategy included an electronic
               search of the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialized Register, the
               Cochrane EPOC Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane
               Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ISI
               Web of Science: (SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S). We handsearched the
               Journal of Trauma, Injury, Annals of Emergency Medicine,
               Academic Emergency Medicine, and Injury Prevention. We searched
               two clinical trial registries: 1) The World Health Organization
               International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and, 2) Clinical
               Trials.gov. We also contacted content experts for further
               articles. The most recent electronic search was completed in
               December 2008 and the handsearch was completed up to February
               2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomized controlled
               trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after
               studies, and interrupted time series studies that used audit
               filters as an intervention for improving processes of care,
               morbidity, or mortality for severely injured patients. DATA
               COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the
               search results, applied inclusion criteria, and extracted data.
               MAIN RESULTS: There were no studies identified that met the
               inclusion criteria for this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We
               were unable to identify any studies of sufficient methodological
               quality to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of audit
               filters as a performance improvement intervention in trauma
               systems. Future research using rigorous study designs should
               focus on the relative effectiveness of audit filters in
               comparison to alternative quality improvement strategies at

               preventable deaths, and classify all the errors with universal
               language. METHODS: We studied all trauma patients over 16
               admitted to the critical care unit or who died before. In
               multidisciplinary sessions we decided which deaths were
               preventable, potentially preventable and non preventable. Guided
               by ATLS protocols, we detected errors in their management that
               were classified using the taxonomy of Joint Commission. RESULTS:
               We registered 1236 trauma patients (ISS 20.77). Of the 115
               trauma deaths, 19 were preventable or potentially preventable
               deaths. We recorded 130 errors in all deaths, 46 of them in
               preventable or potentially preventable deaths. Using our own
               classification, the main errors were delay in starting correct
               treatment or performance of CT in hemodynamically unstable
               patients. Using the taxonomy of Joint Commission, the main type
               error was clinical, during the intervention: the delay in
               initiating correct treatment. Mistakes were made in the
               emergency department by medical specialists. The incidence of
               therapeutic and diagnostic errors was similar. The main cause of
               error was human failure, specifically 'rule-based' errors

               step on the way to improving the quality of care for trauma
               patients. A common language like the taxonomy of Joint

               proportion includes 51\% of prehospital contacts, 67\% of those
               treated in the emergency department (ED), and 40\% of those
               treated post-ED (operating room, intensive care unit, and
               floor). Issues with care were predominantly related to
               management of the airway, fluid resuscitation, and chest injury
               diagnosis and management. CONCLUSIONS: The preventable death
               rate from trauma demonstrated in Utah is similar to that found
               in other settings where the trauma system is under development
               but has not reached full maturity. OFIs predominantly exist in
               the ED and relate to airway management, fluid resuscitation, and
               chest injury management. Resource organization and education of
               ED primary care providers in basic principles of stabilization
               and initial treatment may be the most cost-effective method of
               reducing preventable deaths in this mixed urban and rural
               setting. Similar opportunities exist in the prehospital and
               post-ED phases of care.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma
               has created a ``Trauma Quality Improvement Program'' (TQIP) that
               uses the existing infrastructure of Committee on Trauma
               programs. As the first step toward full implementation of TQIP,
               a pilot study was conducted in 23 American College of Surgeons
               verified or state designated Level I and II trauma centers. This
               study details the feasibility and acceptance of TQIP among the
               participating centers. METHODS: Data from the National Trauma
               Data Bank for patients admitted to pilot study hospitals during
               2007 were used (15,801 patients). A multivariable logistic
               regression model was developed to estimate risk-adjusted
               mortality in aggregate and on three prespecified subgroups (1:
               blunt multisystem, 2: penetrating truncal, and 3: blunt
               single-system injury). Benchmark reports were developed with
               each center's risk adjusted mortality (expressed as an
               observed-to-expected [O/E] mortality ratio and 90\% confidence
               interval [CI]) and crude complication rates available for
               comparison. Reports were deidentified with only the recipient
               having access to their performance relative to their peers.
               Feedback from individual centers regarding the utility of the
               reports was collected by survey. RESULTS: Overall crude
               mortality was 7.7\% and in cohorts 1 to 3 was 16.4\%, 12.4\%,
               and 5.1\%, respectively. In the aggregate risk-adjusted
               analysis, three trauma centers were low outliers (O/E and 90\%
               CI 1) with the remaining 18 centers demonstrating average
               mortality. Challenges identified were in benchmarking mortality
               after penetrating injury due to small sample size and in the
               limited capture of complications. Ninety-two percent of survey
               respondents found the report clear and understandable, and 90\%
               thought that the report was useful. Sixty-three percent of
               respondents will be taking action based on the report.
               CONCLUSIONS: Using the National Trauma Data Bank infrastructure
               to provide risk-adjusted benchmarking of trauma center mortality
               is feasible and perceived as useful. There are differences in
               O/E ratios across similarly verified or designated centers.
               Substantial work is required to allow for morbidity
               benchmarking.",

              and medical expenses of hospitalized adult trauma patients.
              SETTING: This study was based at a level I trauma center in
              Taiwan. METHODS: Data for 17,855 adult patients hospitalized from
              January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2015 were retrieved from the
              Trauma Registry System. The primary outcome was in-hospital
              mortality. Secondary outcomes were the hospital length of stay
              (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate, ICU LOS, and
              medical expenses. Chi-square tests were used for categorical
              variables to determine the significance of the associations
              between the predictor and outcome variables. Student t-tests were
              applied to analyze normally distributed data for continuous
              variables, while Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare
              non-normally distributed data. RESULTS: According to the survival
              rate-to-severity score relationship curve, we grouped all adult
              trauma patients based on EISS scores of $\geq$ 27, 9-26, and < 9.
              Significantly higher mortality rates were noted in patients with
              EISS $\geq$ 27 and those with EISS of 9-26 when compared to
              patients with EISS < 9; this finding concurred to the findings
              for groups classified by the ISS and NISS with the cut-off points
              set between 25 and 16. The hospital LOS, ICU admission rates, and
              medical expenses for patients with EISS $\geq$ 27 and patients
              with EISS of 9-26 were also significantly longer and higher than
              that of patients with EISS < 9. When comparing the demographics
              and detailed medical expenses of very severely injured adult
              trauma patients classified according to ISS, NISS, and EISS,
              patients with ISS $\geq$ 25 and NISS $\geq$ 25 both had
              significantly lower mortality rates, lower ICU admission rates,
              and shorter ICU LOS compared to patients with EISS $\geq$ 27.
              CONCLUSIONS: EISS 9 and 27 can serve as two cut-off points
              regarding injury severity, and patients with EISS $\geq$ 27 have
              the greatest injury severity. Additionally, these patients have
              the highest mortality rate, the highest ICU admission rate, and
              the longest ICU LOS compared to those with ISS $\geq$ 25 and NISS
              $\geq$ 25, suggesting that patients with EISS $\geq$ 27 have the
              worst outcome.",

               Prospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was
               a prospective observational study on two hundred elderly trauma
               patients who were admitted to JSS Hospital, Mysuru over a
               consecutive period of 18 months between December 2016 to May
               2018. On the day of admission, data were collected from each
               patient to compute the ISS, NISS, RTS, and TRISS. RESULTS: Mean
               age of patients was 66.35 years. Most common mechanism of injury
               was road traffic accident (94.0\%) with mortality of 17.0\%. The

               mortality in elderly trauma patient using TRISS system was a
               score of 91.6 (sensitivity 97\%, specificity of 88\%, area under
               ROC curve 0.972), similarly cutoff point under the NISS was
               score of 17(91\%, 93\%, 0.970); for ISS best cutoff point was at
               15(91\%, 89\%, 0.963) and for RTS it was 7.108(97\%,80\%,0.947).
               There were statistical differences among ISS, NISS, RTS and
               TRISS in terms of area under the ROC curve (p <0.0001).
               CONCLUSION: TRISS was the strongest predictor of mortality in

               transfusions, thromboembolic events and organ failure. RESULTS:
               The Fib+ group, despite having similar ISS as Fib-, had higher
               prevalence of penetrating trauma and lower Glasgow Coma Scale
               (GCS), indicating more severe injuries. Patients receiving FC
               had a higher mortality after 24 h/ 30 days/ 1 year compared to
               controls (Fib-). However, in a propensity score matched model,
               the differences in mortality between Fib+ and Fib- were no
               longer significant. Blood transfusions were more common in the
               Fib+ group, but no difference was observed in thromboembolic
               events or organ failure. In both groups, low as well as high
               P-fibrinogen levels at arrival were associated with increased
               mortality, with the lowest mortality observed at P-fibrinogen
               values of 2-3 g/l. CONCLUSIONS: Despite equal ISS, patients
               receiving FC had a higher mortality compared to the control
               group, presumably associated to the fact that these patients
               were bleeding and physiologically deranged on arrival. When
               applying a propensity score matching approach, the difference in
               mortality between the groups was no longer significant. No
               differences were observed between the groups regarding
               thromboembolic events or organ failure, despite higher
               transfusion volumes in patients receiving FC.",

               of elderly patients. Although age and Injury Severity Score are
               independently associated with mortality, trauma centers were
               originally designed to care for seriously injured patients
               without age-specific guidelines. We hypothesized that elderly
               patients would have different complication patterns than their
               younger counterparts. METHODS: The trauma registry of an
               American College of Surgeons -verified Level I trauma center was
               queried for all patients older than 14 years admitted between
               January 2005 and December 2008. Mechanism, mortality, and
               complications were evaluated after dividing patients into eight
               age groups. RESULTS: Of the 15,223 patients, 13\% were elderly
               ($\geq$65), and 86\% were injured via a blunt mechanism.
               Increasing age correlated with fatality (all Injury Severity
               Scores), end-organ failure, and thromboembolic complications
               (deep venous thrombosis and coagulopathy). Analysis revealed a
               significant breakpoint at 45 years of age for mortality,
               decubitus ulcer, and renal failure (all p values <0.05).
               Infectious complications (sepsis, wound infection, and abscess)
               all peaked between 45 years and 65 years and then declined with
               increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: We document that elderly trauma
               patients suffer the same complications as their younger
               counterparts, albeit at a different rate. More importantly, we
               identified a ``breakpoint'' of increased risk of complications
               and mortality at greater than 45 years. Although the mechanisms
               behind these observations remain unknown, understanding their
               unique patterns may allow appropriate allocation of resources

               associated with a lower risk of mortality in severely injured
               patients, especially in premenopausal women. Previous clinical
               studies have shown contradictory results regarding protective
               effects of gender on outcome after severe trauma. The objective
               of this study was to determine the association between gender
               and outcome (mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission)
               among severely injured patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: A
               retrospective multicentre study was performed including all
               polytrauma patients (Injury Severity Score (ISS) $\geq$16)
               admitted to the ED of three level 1 trauma centres, between
               January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2014. Data on age, gender,
               mechanism of injury, ISS, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS),
               prehospital intubation, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), systolic
               blood pressure (SBP) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) upon admission
               at the Emergency Department was collected from three Regional
               Trauma Registries. To determine whether gender was an
               independent predictor of mortality and ICU admission, logistic
               regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among 6865 trauma
               patients, male patients had a significantly higher ISS compared
               to female patients (26.3 $\pm$ 10.2 vs 25.3 $\pm$ 9.7, P = <
               0.0001). Blunt trauma was significantly more common in the
               female group (95.2\% vs 92.3\%, P = < 0.0001). Males aged 16- to
               44-years had a significant higher in-hospital mortality rate
               (10.4\% vs 13.4\%, P = 0.046). ICU admission rate was
               significantly lower in females (49.3\% vs 54.5\%, P = < 0.0001).
               In the overall group, logistic regression did not show gender as
               an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality (OR 1.020
               (95\% CI 0.865-1.204), P = 0.811) or mortality within 24 h (OR
               1.049 (95\% CI 0.829-1.327), P = 0.693). However, male gender
               was associated with an increased likelihood for ICU admission in
               the overall group (OR 1.205 (95\% CI 1.046-1.388), P = 0.010).
               CONCLUSION: The current study shows that in this population of
               severely injured patients, female sex is associated with a lower
               in-hospital mortality rate among those aged 16- to 44-years.
               Furthermore, female sex is independently associated with an
               overall decreased likelihood for ICU admission. More research is

               to estimate preventable geriatric trauma mortality in the United
               States and identify PSIs associated with increased preventable
               mortality. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients
               aged $\geq$65 years, in the CMS database, 2017-second quarter of
               2020. Risk-adjusted multivariable regression was performed to

               Failure-to-rescue O/E were >1 for 10/11 (91\%) PSIs with
               physiologic and metabolic derangements having the highest O/E

  abstract  = "Clinical experience and previous studies indicate that low
               socioeconomic positions are overrepresented in trauma
               populations. The reason for this social variation in injury risk
               is likely to be multifactorial. Both individual and
               environmental sources of explanation are plausible to
               contribute. We investigated the impact of the influence of
               socioeconomic factors and co-morbidity on the risk of becoming a
               trauma victim in a case-control study including 7,382 trauma
               patients matched in a one to five ratio with controls matched by
               age-, gender- and municipality from a level 1 trauma centre.
               Data from the trauma cohort were linked to national registries.
               Associations between socioeconomic factors and co-morbidity were
               estimated by conditional logistic regression. The trauma
               patients had been treated for psychiatric, substance abuse and
               somatic diagnoses to a higher extent than the controls. In the
               conditional logistic regression analysis a low level of
               education and income as well as co-morbidity (divided into
               psychiatric, substance abuse and somatic diagnoses) were all
               independent risk factors for trauma. Analysing patients with an
               injury severity score >15 separately did not alter the results,
               except for somatic diagnoses not being a risk factor. Recent
               treatment for substance abuse significantly increased the risk
               for trauma. Low level of education and income as well as
               psychiatric, substance abuse and somatic co-morbidity were all
               independent risk factors for trauma. Active substance abuse
               strongly influenced the risk for trauma and had a time dependent
               pattern. These insights can facilitate future implementation of
               injury prevention strategies tailored to specific risk groups.",

              is a well-known procedure for improving trauma care. This study
              analyzes preventable and potentially preventable deaths in German
              trauma patients. METHODS: Patients aged between 16 and 75 years
              with an Injury Severity Score >15 who were primary admitted from
              July 2002 to December 2011 were analyzed in this study. Data from
              the patients' hospital records were retrospectively analyzed, and
              cases were categorized as preventable, potentially preventable,
              and non-preventable deaths. In addition, trauma management was
              screened for errors. RESULTS: 2304 patients were admitted from
              July 2002 to December 2011. 763 of which fulfilled the defined
              criteria. The mortality rate was 25.3 \%. Eight cases (4.2 \%)
              were declared as preventable deaths and 31 cases (16.1 \%) as
              potentially preventable deaths. The most common errors in
              preclinical trauma care related to airway management. The main
              clinical error was insufficient hemorrhage control. Fluid
              overload from infusion was the second most common fault in both.
              CONCLUSIONS: Preventable and potentially preventable errors still
              occur in the treatment of severely injured patients. Errors in
              hemorrhage control and airway management are the most common
              human treatment errors. The knowledge of these errors could help
              to improve trauma care in the future.",

               in Western industrialized countries. The aim of the present
               study was to determine the preventability of traumatic deaths,
               analyze the medical measures related to preventable deaths,
               detect management failures, and reveal specific injury patterns
               in order to avoid traumatic deaths in Berlin. MATERIALS AND
               METHODS: In this prospective observational study all autopsied,
               direct trauma fatalities in Berlin in 2010 were included with
               systematic data acquisition, including police files, medical
               records, death certificates, and autopsy records. An
               interdisciplinary expert board judged the preventability of
               traumatic death according to the classification of
               non-preventable (NP), potentially preventable (PP), and
               definitively preventable (DP) fatalities. RESULTS: Of the
               fatalities recorded, 84.9 \% (n = 224) were classified as NP,
               9.8 \% (n = 26) as PP, and 5.3 \% (n = 14) as DP. The incidence
               of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) was significantly lower
               in PP/DP than in NP, and the incidence of fatal exsanguinations
               was significantly higher. Most PP and NP deaths occurred in the
               prehospital setting. Notably, no PP or DP was recorded for
               fatalities treated by a HEMS crew. Causes of DP deaths consisted
               of tension pneumothorax, unrecognized trauma, exsanguinations,
               asphyxia, and occult bleeding with a false negative computed
               tomography scan. CONCLUSIONS: The trauma mortality in Berlin,
               compared to worldwide published data, is low. Nevertheless, 15.2
               \% (n = 40) of traumatic deaths were classified as preventable.
               Compulsory training in trauma management might further reduce
               trauma-related mortality. The main focus should remain on
               prevention programs, as the majority of the fatalities occurred
               as a result of non-survivable injuries.",
