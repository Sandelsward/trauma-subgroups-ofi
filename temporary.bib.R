               of elderly patients. Although age and Injury Severity Score are
               independently associated with mortality, trauma centers were
               originally designed to care for seriously injured patients
               without age-specific guidelines. We hypothesized that elderly
               patients would have different complication patterns than their
               younger counterparts. METHODS: The trauma registry of an
               American College of Surgeons -verified Level I trauma center was
               queried for all patients older than 14 years admitted between
               January 2005 and December 2008. Mechanism, mortality, and
               complications were evaluated after dividing patients into eight
               age groups. RESULTS: Of the 15,223 patients, 13\% were elderly
               ($\geq$65), and 86\% were injured via a blunt mechanism.
               Increasing age correlated with fatality (all Injury Severity
               Scores), end-organ failure, and thromboembolic complications
               (deep venous thrombosis and coagulopathy). Analysis revealed a
               significant breakpoint at 45 years of age for mortality,
               decubitus ulcer, and renal failure (all p values <0.05).
               Infectious complications (sepsis, wound infection, and abscess)
               all peaked between 45 years and 65 years and then declined with
               increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: We document that elderly trauma
               patients suffer the same complications as their younger
               counterparts, albeit at a different rate. More importantly, we
               identified a ``breakpoint'' of increased risk of complications
               and mortality at greater than 45 years. Although the mechanisms
               behind these observations remain unknown, understanding their
               unique patterns may allow appropriate allocation of resources
               and focus research efforts on interventions that should improve
               outcomes.",

               associated with a lower risk of mortality in severely injured
               patients, especially in premenopausal women. Previous clinical
               studies have shown contradictory results regarding protective
               effects of gender on outcome after severe trauma. The objective
               of this study was to determine the association between gender
               and outcome (mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission)
               among severely injured patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: A
               retrospective multicentre study was performed including all
               polytrauma patients (Injury Severity Score (ISS) $\geq$16)
               admitted to the ED of three level 1 trauma centres, between
               January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2014. Data on age, gender,
               mechanism of injury, ISS, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS),
               prehospital intubation, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), systolic
               blood pressure (SBP) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) upon admission
               at the Emergency Department was collected from three Regional
               Trauma Registries. To determine whether gender was an
               independent predictor of mortality and ICU admission, logistic
               regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among 6865 trauma
               patients, male patients had a significantly higher ISS compared
               to female patients (26.3 $\pm$ 10.2 vs 25.3 $\pm$ 9.7, P = <
               0.0001). Blunt trauma was significantly more common in the
               female group (95.2\% vs 92.3\%, P = < 0.0001). Males aged 16- to
               44-years had a significant higher in-hospital mortality rate
               (10.4\% vs 13.4\%, P = 0.046). ICU admission rate was
               significantly lower in females (49.3\% vs 54.5\%, P = < 0.0001).
               In the overall group, logistic regression did not show gender as
               an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality (OR 1.020
               (95\% CI 0.865-1.204), P = 0.811) or mortality within 24 h (OR
               1.049 (95\% CI 0.829-1.327), P = 0.693). However, male gender
               was associated with an increased likelihood for ICU admission in
               the overall group (OR 1.205 (95\% CI 1.046-1.388), P = 0.010).
               CONCLUSION: The current study shows that in this population of
               severely injured patients, female sex is associated with a lower
               in-hospital mortality rate among those aged 16- to 44-years.
               Furthermore, female sex is independently associated with an
               overall decreased likelihood for ICU admission. More research is

               States and identify PSIs associated with increased preventable
               mortality. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients
               aged $\geq$65 years, in the CMS database, 2017-second quarter of
               2020. Risk-adjusted multivariable regression was performed to
               calculate observed-to-expected (O/E) mortality ratios for
               failure-to-prevent and failure-to-rescue PSIs with significance
               defined as P 1 for all PSIs evaluated with central line-related
               blood stream infection having a high O/E (747.93).
               Failure-to-rescue O/E were >1 for 10/11 (91\%) PSIs with
               physiologic and metabolic derangements having the highest O/E

               geriatric trauma patients experienced reduced preventable
               mortality. CONCLUSION: Odds of preventable mortality increases
               with age. Perioperative venous thrombotic events, hemorrhage or
               hematoma, and postoperative physiologic/metabolic derangements
               produce significant preventable mortalities. United States'

               education and income as well as co-morbidity (divided into
               psychiatric, substance abuse and somatic diagnoses) were all
               independent risk factors for trauma. Analysing patients with an
               injury severity score >15 separately did not alter the results,
               except for somatic diagnoses not being a risk factor. Recent
               treatment for substance abuse significantly increased the risk
               for trauma. Low level of education and income as well as
               psychiatric, substance abuse and somatic co-morbidity were all
               independent risk factors for trauma. Active substance abuse
               strongly influenced the risk for trauma and had a time dependent
               pattern. These insights can facilitate future implementation of
               injury prevention strategies tailored to specific risk groups.",

              is a well-known procedure for improving trauma care. This study
              analyzes preventable and potentially preventable deaths in German
              trauma patients. METHODS: Patients aged between 16 and 75 years
              with an Injury Severity Score >15 who were primary admitted from
              July 2002 to December 2011 were analyzed in this study. Data from
              the patients' hospital records were retrospectively analyzed, and
              cases were categorized as preventable, potentially preventable,
              and non-preventable deaths. In addition, trauma management was
              screened for errors. RESULTS: 2304 patients were admitted from
              July 2002 to December 2011. 763 of which fulfilled the defined
              criteria. The mortality rate was 25.3 \%. Eight cases (4.2 \%)
              were declared as preventable deaths and 31 cases (16.1 \%) as
              potentially preventable deaths. The most common errors in
              preclinical trauma care related to airway management. The main
              clinical error was insufficient hemorrhage control. Fluid
              overload from infusion was the second most common fault in both.
              CONCLUSIONS: Preventable and potentially preventable errors still
              occur in the treatment of severely injured patients. Errors in
              hemorrhage control and airway management are the most common
              human treatment errors. The knowledge of these errors could help
              to improve trauma care in the future.",

               in Western industrialized countries. The aim of the present
               study was to determine the preventability of traumatic deaths,
               analyze the medical measures related to preventable deaths,
               detect management failures, and reveal specific injury patterns
               in order to avoid traumatic deaths in Berlin. MATERIALS AND
               METHODS: In this prospective observational study all autopsied,
               direct trauma fatalities in Berlin in 2010 were included with
               systematic data acquisition, including police files, medical
               records, death certificates, and autopsy records. An
               interdisciplinary expert board judged the preventability of
               traumatic death according to the classification of
               non-preventable (NP), potentially preventable (PP), and
               definitively preventable (DP) fatalities. RESULTS: Of the
               fatalities recorded, 84.9 \% (n = 224) were classified as NP,
               9.8 \% (n = 26) as PP, and 5.3 \% (n = 14) as DP. The incidence
               of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) was significantly lower
               in PP/DP than in NP, and the incidence of fatal exsanguinations
               was significantly higher. Most PP and NP deaths occurred in the
               prehospital setting. Notably, no PP or DP was recorded for
               fatalities treated by a HEMS crew. Causes of DP deaths consisted
               of tension pneumothorax, unrecognized trauma, exsanguinations,
               asphyxia, and occult bleeding with a false negative computed
               tomography scan. CONCLUSIONS: The trauma mortality in Berlin,
               compared to worldwide published data, is low. Nevertheless, 15.2
               \% (n = 40) of traumatic deaths were classified as preventable.
               Compulsory training in trauma management might further reduce
               trauma-related mortality. The main focus should remain on
               prevention programs, as the majority of the fatalities occurred
               as a result of non-survivable injuries.",
